#Packaging (Not mandatory)

You can directly use a release (https://github.com/Stratehm/stratum-proxy/releases) and go to the Installation and Usage section.

The packaging of the application is done through Maven and will generate a ZIP which contains the program and all its dependencies.

The proxy is is generated as a JAR file called stratum-proxy.jar (contained in the ZIP file) which can be launched on any platform with a JVM installed with version >= 7 (Java Virtual Machine)

To build the package, you must have a JDK installed in version >= 7 and maven 3

##Packaging

```sh
cd /directory/which/contain/pom.xmlFileOfTheProject

mvn clean package
```

The package is then present in the "target" directory.

#Installation and Usage

##Installation

The latest JVM (Java Virtual Machine) can be downloaded here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
Install the JVM for your operating system (if not already done)

Then unzip the zip file in a directory and launch the proxy through the following command line:

```sh
java -jar stratum-proxy.jar proxyOptions
```

##Usage

```sh
java -jar stratum-proxy.jar --help
```

##Configuration File

In order to use a configuration file instead of the command line parameters, use the following command line options:

```sh
java -jar stratum-proxy.jar -f /path/to/the/configuration/file
```

When -f option is used, all other command line options are discarded and only the configuration file is used.

The files stratum-proxy-minimal-sample.conf and stratum-proxy-full-sample.conf in the package can be used to build your own configuration file.

##WebClient

A WebClient is available at the address: http://127.0.0.1:8888 (The port can be changed with --rest-listen-port or apiListenAddress of configuration file).
